# A Restricted Random Walk

## Overview

This repository contains the material I had for a Math and Physics Club
presentation on a restricted random walk problem. It contains:

- Lecture notes: In the end I didn't really use them, but I might as well archive them.
- The presentation: This is made in manim and manim-slides. For information about running see the next section.
- Some math paper(s): In corresponding with friends/teachers about the problem, I detailed some of the work involved.

I do also have other elements related to the problem (such as an animated simulation and empirical support) in other repositories.

## Running

Make sure you have `manim` and `manim-slides` installed through their respective methods. One should be able to run
```sh
make slides
```
to compile the slides and then
```sh
make present
```
to view the presentation, assuming everything is installed correctly.
